                        At Vikk AI, we started with a bold idea: to make legal guidance accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford expensive consultations. In just one year, that vision has resonated with thousands of people.

                        Each conversation represents a real person with real questions. From family law to housing, from small business to consumer rights, we've seen firsthand the wide range of legal needs people face every day.
